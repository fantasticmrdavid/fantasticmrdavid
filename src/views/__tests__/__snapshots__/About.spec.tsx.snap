            Hi! I'm David, and I like making things.
            <br />
            <br />
            Since I was a kid I've been passionate about building and creating. I've always enjoyed the journey of taking an idea from concept and making it reality.
            <br />
            <br />
            I firmly believe that by empowering people with problem solving technology and empathy we can build a better world together.

            I've been building web projects for over a decade, starting from when I was in high school and needed a simple HTML page to display my artwork. From there my journey has taken me to Full-Stack LAMP Development working on vendor-side and agency projects alike, and then to leading Front-End and UX Engineering specialising in HTML5, CSS3, ES6 JavaScript and React. I love learning about new technologies to develop better and more effective ways to solve problems and get things done.

            Hi! I'm David, and I like making things.
            <br />
            <br />
            Since I was a kid I've been passionate about building and creating. I've always enjoyed the journey of taking an idea from concept and making it reality.
            <br />
            <br />
            I firmly believe that by empowering people with problem solving technology and empathy we can build a better world together.

            I've been building web projects for over a decade, starting from when I was in high school and needed a simple HTML page to display my artwork. From there my journey has taken me to Full-Stack LAMP Development working on vendor-side and agency projects alike, and then to leading Front-End and UX Engineering specialising in HTML5, CSS3, ES6 JavaScript and React. I love learning about new technologies to develop better and more effective ways to solve problems and get things done.
